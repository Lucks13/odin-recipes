    <h2 class="sub-titles">What ingredients are necessary for a good lemon ice cream?</h2>

    <ul>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 ⅛ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half cream</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¾ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="sub-titles">Hopefully you got all the ingredients, now how do make it?</h2>

    <ol>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <li>Combine heavy cream, sugar, half-and-half, and lemon zest in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover the saucepan, and allow to steep for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover the saucepan and bring back to a simmer over low heat. Beat egg yolks in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk 1 cup hot cream mixture into eggs, several tablespoons at a time. (This brings eggs up to temperature without scrambling them.) Stir egg mixture back into cream mixture in the saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat until mixture coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Stir lemon juice into chiled ice cream mixture. Freeze in a 4- to 5-quart ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions. Transfer ice cream to a lidded freezer container, then freeze for about 4 hours to ripen flavors before serving.</li>
